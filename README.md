#### Flags

| Flag              | Effect                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `-h` `--help`    | Display help information                     |

### Python Module

Quickalias's main functions are avalible in other python programs as a module.  
An example program using this module:

```Python
# test.py

# Detecting the process calling the program

# Importing the module
import quickalias

# Initalizing the class
quickalias = quickalias.QuickAlias()

print(quickalias.detect_shell())
```

When running this program from a zsh shell it prints the following:

``` shell
$ python3 test.py
/usr/bin/zsh
```

The functions avalible in the module are the following:

* `detect_shell() -> str` - Returns the process calling the program
* `get_home_dir() -> str` - Returns the home directory of the user calling the function
* `get_shell_config_file(home: str) -> str` - Attempts to determine the config file for a provided shell.
* `generate_alias_command(alias: str, command: str, shell: str) -> any` - Take an alias and a command to be aliased and returns an alias command appropriate for the shell. *will return a list to be passed to subprocess.run if the shell is fish*
* `write_alias(alias_command: str, config_file: str) -> str` - Intended to write the output of `generate_alias_command()` to the location provided by `get_shell_config_file()`
